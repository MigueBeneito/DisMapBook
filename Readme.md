# Annex online material for the book: "Disease mapping: from foundations to multidimensional modeling"

This webpage is intended to host the annex online material for the book: "Disease mapping: from foundations to multidimensional modeling", published by CRC/Chapman & Hall (2019) and authored by Miguel A. Martinez-Beneito and Paloma Botella-Rocamora. In our opinion, this is a valuable complement to the content of the book so hope you will take the most advantage of it.

The material in this repository is arranged in several folders, containing: 
* The material needed to reproduce the exercises of each chapter in the book. Folder [Exercises](tree/master/Exercises).
* The material (data/cartographies) needed to reproduce the examples in the book. Folder [Data](tree/master/Data).
* The `R` code needed to reproduce the examples in the book. Set of folders ExampleX_Y, where X stands for the chapter of that example and Y is a sequential number.

We suggest you to clone the repository, or simply download a ZIP file with all its content, by pushing the "clone or download" button at the upper-right side of this page. Once done that you should be able to reproduce all the examples in the book and solve the proposed exercises. 

Each folder corresponding to a different Example contains the same files. A `.Rproj` file corresponding to a R-studio `R` project. We encourage you to install R-studio and open this file for each example in order to run its routines. If you make this and open the corresponding `.Rproj` file, the code corresponding to that Example should (hopefully) work fine. You will also find a `.Rmd` file at each folder, which is a Rmarkdown document containing `R` code and some text. If you want to compile this document you should have the `Rmarkdown` library of `R` previously installed. If you haven't it installed we encourage you also to do it. If you compile the `.Rmd` file you should obtain a pdf document similar to that contained in the corresponding folder. You can either compile the `.Rmd` by yourself or simply read the provided pdf file, it's up to you. Obviously, compiling the `.Rmd` document by yourself will allow you to explore the results in each example with greater detail.

Note that for most of the examples you will not reproduce exactly the same results than us in the provided pdf documents. The data sets provided have been modified in order to preserve the confidentiality of the original data so the results that you will reproduce will not be exactly equal to ours. Nevertheless, you should obtain very similar results since the modified data try to resemble closely the corresponding original data sets.

Hope you find this material interesting and take it as much profit as possible.
