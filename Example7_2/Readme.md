#  Example 7.2

Annex online material for Example 7.2 of the book: "Disease mapping: from foundations to multidimensional modeling", published by CRC/Chapman & Hall and authored by Miguel A. Martinez-Beneito and Paloma Botella Rocamora. This repository contains a pdf document that reproduces in detail the statistical analysis made in this book example. That document would surely be enough for any detail that you could be interested in. Nevertheless, if you wanted to execute the code in that document by yourself (with slightly modified data), we recommend you to download all the annex material related to the book (see the repository containing this folder). In that case we advise you to open the `.Rproj` file in this folder with Rstudio and try to compile the corresponding `.Rmd` document.
